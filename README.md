"# Grocers" 

I developed a website to buy groceries online, called Grocery Warehouse
I built the site with the following tools:
1- VS Code
2- Angular
3- Node JS
4- MongoDB
There are two interfaces:
user interface: the user can buy, browse, search for products, and also add products to the cart, delete from the cart and update the cart and view the request and the status of the request, as well as his previous requests, and finally can you leave a comment and put likes
admin interface: He can add, change and delete products and view pending and approved orders as well

To enter the admin interface, use the following data 
Email: Admin@admin.com
Pass:12345678
To run the program:
1-Cd Grocery-store 
 2- npm start
 3-Cd Server 
4 -node index.js
